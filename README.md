# BTP Diagrams

This repository contains the source code for all the diagrams used in my Bachelor's Thesis Project.
I also uploaded some of the diagrams, which ultimately didn't make it to the report's final version.
All the diagrams are my works. I took example data points for some figures from the existing datasets and have cited/acknowledged these within the report.

Please check inside the `Graphics` folder for the diagrams/plots.

## Coming soon
Details for each diagrams coming soon. Code to create the diagrams/plots are present for most of the ones included in the final BTP; soon, the repository will be updated with the code for the remaining ones.
