# BTP Diagrams

This repository contains the source code for all the diagrams used in my Bachelor's Thesis Project.
I also upload some of the diagrams which ultimately didn't make it to the final version of the report.
All the diagrams are my works, although the examples of tweet and their annotations shown in the diagrams were taken from the datasets considered in the report.

Please check inside `Graphics` folder for the diagrams/plots.

## Coming soon
Details for each diagrams coming soon. As of now, code to create the diagrams/plots are present for most of the onces included in the final BTP, soon the repository will be updated with the code for the remaining ones as well
